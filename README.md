# Appwrite-Test
Android app for appwrite testing

In this app, the user will start with a login screen.
Once loged in, each user will have his collection of penguins, each penguin will have a [name], an [age], an [height] and [hat].
The data base and user identification will be hosted on an Appwrite local server (later a cloud server).

The goal is to learn how to use Appwrite BaaS, user authentification and databases.
